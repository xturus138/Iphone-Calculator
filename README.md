# MOBILE-PABCL2024

A user-friendly calculator project, drawing inspiration from the iPhone calculator, has been developed for assignment codelabs. Almost everything I coded is explained in the project code. The code is simple and easy to understand because itÂ implies simple logic. If you have any further questions, please email me at the end of the description.

<h1>FAQ ðŸ¤”</h1>

#### Can I download it for my personal use?

You certainly can! If somebody want to making this calculator better, it would be great!. Perhaps we could have a chat âœ¨âœ¨.


#### Are there any sanctions for copying your project?

No, but it would be greatly appreciated if you could make a brief mention of me ðŸ˜Š.
